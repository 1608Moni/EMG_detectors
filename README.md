# EMG detectors

 Matlab code for a set of EMG detectors for low SNR EMG.
 
 The code was developed in MATLAB R2020 
 
 The repository is origainsed into three folders 
 1. data : Contains the simulated data used in this analysis
 2. detectors_review_paper : Contains the files that are used for evlauating the performance of the detectors
 3. library : Folder with the different detector algorithm
 
 To run the analysis for different detectors - run the [main.m](https://github.com/1608Moni/EMG_detectors/blob/main/detectors_review_paper/main.m). 
 To compute the cost - use [Computecost.m] file
